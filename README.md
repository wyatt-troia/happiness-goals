# Happiness Goals

An app that allows users to set and track happiness-supporting goals, built using [Python](https://www.python.org/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). 

Users can choose from a set of goals recommended by [positive psychologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology), or they can set custom goals. 

Goal performance is visualized using [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).
